# VITAS
##1. See the code directory for codes. Use 'python main.py' to start using VITAS. Change the config.ini to add your own account, or you can use the account that we provide.
##2. You can add '-e + <excel name>' to change the excel name, add '-l + <path>' to set a path to store logs, add '-o + <path' to save the problem list. You can use '-c' to start using the chatbot, but we recommand not to because the ui of the chatbot is always changing.
##3. We need to login to the amazon developer account to start using the simulator. Sometimes the verification code is required to login. But in most of the cases amazon will send an email to the linked email address. We use pop to read the emails, so make sure your 110 port is open.
##4. We save the cookies in the cookie directory, but they maybe useless after a period of time. If you discover that VITAS fails to get skills' outputs from the simulator, just delete the cookies and restart, we will generate new cookies for you.

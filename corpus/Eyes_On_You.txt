This is small skill that Alexa performs.
When you ask Alexa "Open Eyes On You", Alexa will ask you for a person's name.
Then after you respond Alexa will respond by repeating the person's name and saying "Alexa is watching you".
That's it.
Don't be fooled like my wife, Alexa really can't watch somebody.
This is just a goofy skill that I created so that my kids would think that someone is watching them so that they would behave.
